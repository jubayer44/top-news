            <h4>1) Difference between var, let and const?</h4>
            <h5 class="text-muted">Answer: <br>
                var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be
                accessed only within that function. <br>

                let is the new update of SE6, let is block scoped, if a variable declared in a block with let is only
                available for use within that block, Its value can be changed. <br>

                const is the new update of ES6, const declarations are block scoped, it's cannot be updated or
                re-declared.</h5>

            <h4>2) Difference of arrow function and regular function?</h4>
            <h5 class="text-muted">Answer: <br>
                Arrow functions do not have an arguments binding. However, they have access to the arguments object of
                the closest non-arrow parent function. Named and rest parameters are heavily relied upon to capture the
                arguments passed to arrow functions. <br> <br>

                Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this. The value of this inside an arrow
                function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of
                this in the closest non-arrow parent function. <br> <br>

                Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether in strict or non-strict mode.</h5>

            <h4>3) Difference between Map, forEach, Filter and Find?</h4>
            <h5 class="text-muted">Answer: <br>
                Map using for Loop through an array, if the map is written in a single line, it returns automatically
                without writing the return. <br> <br>

                ForEach using for loop in an array. But it doesn't return.<br> <br>

                Map using for Loop through an array, There is a condition inside the filter, as long as the condition is
                true, the result will be filtered and outputted. <br> <br>
                Map using for Loop through an array, There is a condition inside the find, after the first condition is
                true the find will stop with the output.</h5>
            <h4>4) Why do we use template strings?</h4>
            <h5 class="text-muted">Answer: <br>
                Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older
                versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.
